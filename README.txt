Refactor `todoList` service, and add a `removeTodo` method that will
remove given todo from the server

Make sure to display "remove" button next to done todo items.

Make sure that ng-click on the button will call remove todo, and will
remove todo from the server using `removeTodo` method.

Make sure that during http call the button will be disabled.
